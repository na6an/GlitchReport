# Power Surge
### Related service provider: MegaBus  
## Background:
Back in 2015, I was returning to Atlanta after visiting my family near Washington D.C.  
I did not want to drive almost 10 hours one way, so I left my car in Atlanta and was riding a bus for the round trip.  

MegaBus was one of a few options I had at the time.  
I could not really schedule ahead of the trip to book a flight,  
and other buses simply made trip longer by requiring a transfer or were red eye trips in inconvenient departure time.  

However, that trip ended up to be a nightmare.  
All I do when I ride for such long hours is either sleeping or use smartphone/tablet to kill time.  
Thus, an extra method to charge devices was important to me.  
Many bus services including MegaBus offer power outlets like this in many seats.

I was plugging this usb wall adapter to charge my devices.

When the bus was probably about three or four hours left to Atlanta,  
I noticed there was a small spark has flashed around my cell phone connector, shutting the cell off.  
I was astonished, quickly detached the connector from my devices.  
Fortunately, the phone was still alive, worked fine after a boot up, but the adapter no longer worked  
and the metal pin portion of the connector cable was burnt like this.

Worse part was, the bus has been malfunctioning since after;  
speed of the bus was slow down to about 20 mph and A/C began not working.  
The bus driver tried another 2~30 minutes before declaring unable to drive.  
Eventually, the bus was side stopped at the highway for over two hours until MegaBus dispatched another bus.

The arrival time was 9:40 PM according to this receipt, but it was almost 3 AM when we arrived.  
A few days later, MegaBus has issued a full refund for the trip.

## Root Cause:
It is pretty clear power surge was the likely cause of the bus breakdown.  
The surge probably fried up fuse or spark plug of the bus. Exact source of the surge, however, isn’t really clear.  

Perhaps, my adapter was responsible for the breakdown.  
In fact, there are some Amazon reviews say the adapter broke devices connected to it.  
Or maybe it was simply the bus failure - spark could be just a symptom.  
Or maybe someone else’s device could be the cause.  

Whatever the reason was, it’s likely the electrical system of the bus was not design protected against surge.
